Customize Logs and Statuses
===========================

``log`` and ``status`` commands print information about wrapped repository annotated by performance
profiles. ``perun log`` command lists the minor versions history for a major version (currently the
checked out), along with the information about registered profiles, such as e.g. the minor version
description, authors, statistics of profiles, etc. ``perun status`` commands shows the overview of
given minor version of current major head and lists profiles associated to profiles and in pending
directory (i.e. the ``.perun/jobs`` directory. List of profiles contains the types of profiles,
numbers, configurations of profiling run, etc.

The format of outputs of both ``log`` and ``status`` can be customized by setting the formatting
strings c.f. :ref:`logs-log` and :ref:`logs-status`. Moreover, outputs are paged (currently using
the ``less -R`` command) by default. To turn off the paging, run the ``perun`` with ``--no-pager``
option (see :doc:`cli`) or set :ckey:`general.paging`.

Customizing Statuses
--------------------

The output of ``perun status`` is defined w.r.t. formatting string specified in configuration in
:ckey:`format.status` key (looked up recursively in the nearest local configuration, or
in global configuration). The formatting string consists of raw delimiters and special tags, which
serves as templates to output specific informations about concrete profiles, such as the profiling
configuration, type of profile, creating timestamps, etc.

E.g. the following formatting string::

     ┃ %type% ┃ %cmd% ┃ %workload% ┃ %collector%  ┃ (%time%) ┃

will yield the following status when running ``perun status`` (both for stored and pending
profiles)::

    ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════▣
      id ┃   type  ┃  cmd   ┃ workload ┃ collector  ┃         time        ┃
    ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════▣
     0@p ┃ [mixed] ┃ target ┃ hello    ┃ complexity ┃ 2017-09-07 14:41:49 ┃
     1@p ┃ [time ] ┃ perun  ┃ status   ┃ time       ┃ 2017-10-19 12:30:29 ┃
     2@p ┃ [time ] ┃ perun  ┃ --help   ┃ time       ┃ 2017-10-19 12:30:31 ┃
    ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════▣

The first column of the ``perun status`` output, ``id``, has a fixed position and defines a tag for
the given profile, which can be used in ``add``, ``rm``, ``show`` and ``postprocessby`` commands as
a quick wildcard for concrete profiles, e.g. ``perun add 0@p`` would register the first profile
stored in the pending ``.perun/jobs`` directory to the index of current head. Tags are always in
form of ``i@p`` (for pending profiles) and ``i@i`` for profiles registered in index, where ``i``
stands for position in the corresponding storage, index from zero.

The specification of the formatting string can contain the following special tags:

``%type%``:
    Lists the most generic type of the profile according to the collected resources serving as
    quick tagging of similar profiles. Currently Perun supports `memory`, `time`, `mixed`.

``%cmd%``:
    Lists the command for which the data was collected, this e.g. corresponds to the binary or
    script that was executed and profiled using collector/profiler. Refer to :ref:`jobs-overview`
    for more information about profiling jobs and commands.

``%workload%``:
    List input workload which was passed to the profiled command, i.e. some inputs of the profiled
    program, script or binary. Refer to :ref:`jobs-overview` for more information about profiling
    jobs and command workloads.

``%collector%``:
    Lists the collector which was used to obtain the given profile. Refer to :doc:`collectors` for
    list of supported collectors and more information about collection of profiles.

``%time%``:
    Timestamp when the profile was last modified in format `YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOURS:MINUTES:SECONDS`.

``%source%``:
    Original source of the profile. This corresponds to the name of the generated profile
    and the original path.

By default the profiles are sorted in ascending order according to the timestamp. The sort order
can be modified by setting either the :ckey:`format.sort_profiles_by` and
:ckey:`format.sort_profiles_order` configuration options, or the :doc:`cli` options ``--sort-by``
and ``--sort-order`` to a valid profile information attribute and a valid sort order. Setting the
command line options ``--sort-by`` and ``--sort-order`` have higher priority than the keys set in
the :ckey:`format.sort_profiles_by` and :ckey:`format.sort_profiles_order`.

Customizing Logs
----------------

The output of ``perun log --short`` is defined w.r.t. formatting string specified in configuration
in :ckey:`format.shortlog` key (looked up recursively in the nearest local
configuration, or in global configuration). The formatting string can contain both raw characters
(such as delimiters, etc.) and special tags, which serves as templates to output information for
concrete minor version such as minor version description, number of assigned profiles, etc.

E.g. the following formatting string::

    '%checksum:6% (%stats%) %desc%'

will yield the following output when running ``perun log --short``::

    minor   (a|m|x|t profiles) info
    53d35c  (2|0|2|0 profiles) Add deleted jobs directory
    07f2b4  (1|0|1|0 profiles) Add necessary files for perun to work on this repo.
    bd3dc3  ---no--profiles--- root


The specification of the formatting string can contain the following special tags:

``%checksum:num%``: Identification of the minor version (should be hash preferably). If we take
    ``git`` as an example ``checksum`` will correspond to the SHA of one commit.

``%stats%``:
    Lists short summary of overall number of profiles (``a``) and number of memory (``m``), mixed
    (``x``) and time (``t``) profiles assinged to given minor version.

``%changes%``:
    Lists a short string of overall found changes for a given minor version. Found degradations are
    represented by red ``-``, while found optimizations are represented by green ``+``.

``%desc:num%``: Lists short description of the minor version, limiting to the first sentence of the
    description. If we take ``git`` as an example this will correspond to the short commit message.

``%date:num%``:
    Lists the date the minor version was commited (in the wrapped vcs).

``%author:num%``:
    Lists the author of the minor version (not commiter).

``%email:num%``:
    Lists the email of the author of the minor version.

``%parents:num%``:
    Lists the parents of the given minor version. Note that one minor version can have potentially
    several parents, e.g. in git, when the merge of two commits happens.

Specifying ``num`` in the selected tags will shorten the displayed identification to ``num``
characters only. In case the specified ``num`` is smaller then the length of the attribute name,
then the shortening will be limited to the lenght of the attribute name.
